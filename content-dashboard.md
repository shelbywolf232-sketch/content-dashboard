# Content Dashboard

> Flow to keep the 7-day content plan and weekly long-form insights organized. I update this every week after receiving your Friday check-in. For each week there is a summary, daily prompt ideas, and trend notes that pull from triathlon and lifestyle sources.

---

## Weekly Rhythm Guide
1. **Friday check-in** – You share:
   - Highlights, struggles, training data, or lifestyle shifts.
   - Available media assets (clips, metrics, voice notes).
   - Goals/focus for the coming week (e.g., race prep, nutrition debug, mindset). 
   - What you noticed in audience feedback or inspiration you want to explore.
2. **Research & trend harvest** – I use that input + public web signals (YouTube shorts, creator drops, triathlon news) to spot "high & fast movers" and translate them into your 7-day structure.
3. **Dashboard update** – Each Monday morning I refresh this board with:
   - Core ideas per day (Honesty, Building in Public, etc.).
   - Reference videos/trends with short summaries.
   - Media prep notes and calls-to-action.
4. **Execution & feedback** – You film/post, then share results (comments, traction) and we repeat.

### YouTube Long Form
- **Title concept:** e.g., "Inside 1 Week of Triathlon Training When You're Chasing 70 kg".
- **Angle:** combine Nick Bare raw push with Magnus Midtbø challenge energy.
- **Trend signal:** mention any longer creator long format trending (Iman Gadzhi, etc.).
- **Structure:** Hook / narrative arc / validation moment / CTA.

### Trend Log (fast movings)

### Research Notes / Reminders
- No current API keys, so research pulls from public YouTube, creator channels, official race updates, high-performing triathlon clips.
- Share TrainingPeaks data or session log if you want me to anchor ideas to specific workouts.
- Mention any high-profile collabs or announcements so I can weave them into hooks.

Whenever I refresh this board it will include updated references and the new Friday checklist items. If you prefer a live web link later, we can layer a GitHub Pages render or a simple static site on top of this markdown.
